# Pivotal Web Server Module for Puppet

This README covers the initial release of the Pivotal Web Server module for puppet. This README assumes the reader has a basic understanding of puppet and Pivotal Web Server.

# About this module

This module installs pivotal-webserver and manages instances. It is important to note that this module uses the newserver command to create the instances. This means that if a configuration variable changes in a manifest that it will not be reflected in the instance unless it is destroyed first and allowed to be recreated.


# Before you begin

This module depends on the pivotal\_repo module.

# Example Usage

*Default options on port 8000* - The following example will install Pivotal Web Server and create an instance called myserver on port 8000

```puppet

  webserver::instance { 'myserver':
    port => '8000',
  }

```

*More Options* - The following example will install Pivotal Web Server and create two instances on the same node running on separate ports
```puppet

  webserver::instance { 'web1':
    port => '8081',
    mpm  => 'worker'
  }

  webserver::instance { 'web2':
    port => '8082',
    mpm  => 'worker'
}
```
